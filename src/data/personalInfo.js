      "A passionate Software Engineer with over 3 years of experience building scalable, high-performance applications. I have a strong foundation in Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, and Full Stack Development, and I'm currently pursuing my Master’s in Software Engineering Systems at Northeastern University, where I continue to deepen my skills and broaden my technical expertise.",
      "At Finastra, I contributed to complex financial systems, working on end-to-end payment workflows, optimizing system performance, and collaborating directly with clients to deliver robust, enterprise-grade solutions. My experience spans backend development, RESTful APIs, and database design, along with frontend technologies like React and Angular. I’m also well-versed in cloud services (AWS), CI/CD pipelines, and infrastructure automation using tools like Terraform.",
      "Whether it's streamlining backend logic, crafting intuitive user interfaces, or automating infrastructure, I thrive on solving real-world problems through clean, maintainable code—and enjoy working with cross-functional teams to build impactful software.",
